#> mat<-cor(mtcars)

cars <- mtcars
 cars$am <- as.factor(cars$am)
levels(cars$am) <-c("Auto", "Manual")

#A simple box plot shows that manual cars do more miles per gallon than Auto cars

plot(cars$am, cars$mpg)


#And a simple linear regresion predicting mpg using transmission shows that a change from Auto to Manual would result in a 7.2 increase in consumption

fit <- lm(mpg ~ am, data= cars)
#using the original mtcars dataset because on this dataset the am variable is a number so it automatic produces  a scaterplot
plot(mtcars$am, mtcars$mpg) 
abline(fit)

#which is also the difference between the means
mean(cars[cars$am == "Manual",]$mpg) - mean(cars[cars$am == "Auto",]$mpg)

We can also do a T-Test on the data

t.test(cars[cars$am == "Auto",]$mpg, cars[cars$am == "Manual",]$mpg) 

which results on a p-value of 0.001374 (well bellow 5%) so quoting the output: "the alternative hypothesis is true: the difference in means is not equal to 0"

This answers our first question, "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG ?"


At this point we already know that the mean gallons per mile of "Manual"" cars is 7.244 MPGs higher than that of "Auto" cars and that the R^2 value is 0.3598, which means that this model only explains 35.98% of the variance. This is quite a  poor fit so We'll try some Multi-Variable Analysis To find a better fitting model.



The question at this point is: which other variable to include?
Initially it would be intuitive to include hp (Gross horsepower), wt (weight) and qsec (1/4 mile time) because in theory the power, weight and speed would directly affect a car's consuption.


In order to check that, we are going to fit a model will all variables and them use the "step" function to check which variables best fit the model

fitall <- lm(mpg ~ ., data=cars)
goodfit<- step(fitall, trace=0)
summary(goodfit)

The function outputs 3 variable wt, qsec and "amManual", which confirms our "intuition".
Actually if we check the p-values of out fitall model we can see that wt, am and qsec are the lowest p-values (and hp is the forth), so not a bad prediction

Looking at the coeficinets we can see for example that the wt coeficient is -3.9165, whihc means that each point increased in mpg will decrease the weight in -3.9165. A better way to interpret that is: Increasing the weight of a car by 3916.5 lb will cause a decrease of 1 milles per gallon, whihc makes sense because it is intuitive that a heavier car does less miles per 1 gallon of fuel.



we can also see that R^2 is 0.8497 which means that this model explains 85% of the variance

summary(fitall)$coef[,4]



Conclusion

cars with Manual Transmission are better than cars with automatic transmission by 2.9 mpg. However, it is not the only factor that affects MPG, a car's weight and its acceleration (1/4 mile time) also seem to affect the result.
